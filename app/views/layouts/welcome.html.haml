        %p At HUSK our wine list is grouped by terroir and soil type, rather than the traditional classifications of political geography or grape varietal. This further connects the concepts of Husk’s wine offerings to the mission of the restaurant.

        %h2 SOCIAL Wine
        %p We support small, artisinal producers whose prime concern is making the best possible wine of which they are capable.  We support Producers who do not manipulate the wine, but let the Terroir speak for itself.  We support Producers who utilize sustainable methods.  We are skewed to cooler climate wines because we believe that acidity is a necessary component in a balanced wine.  Inherently, we are biased towards ‘old world’ wines.  We love red Burgundy!!!  We want everybody to derive as much pleasure as we do from wine.  We want to spread the wine culture as far as we can- Based on intellect, curiosity & Generosity.
